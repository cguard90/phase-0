    What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The goal of all sites is going to be slightly different. In the case of mine with the above site map, it's just going to be information to (hopefully) make me stand out in a positive way to prospective employers. The content will be all things related to me as a person and my coding experiences.

    What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience would be potential employers, and I would want the site to have a very professional lay out, as it would be for a professional purpose. Even though it will be professional, I do want it to accurately reflect how I am as a person and what I can bring to the table as a potential Dev.

    What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I would want them to initially find information about me first. The reason is that I don't want them to contact me if it wouldn't be a good fit for the company. Once the information is located, contacting me should be the next priority. The reason I did not list contacting me second though is because there are multiple facets to a person, so my work history, and relative experience in coding and potentially even my personal life are all important parts of getting to know me. If at this point the employer has determined that I'm a good fit for both the company and the role, then I would like them to contact me.

    What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
I think the history of it is important to understand, as that is driving a lot of changes we're now seeing in websites, and also I think has helped determine which sites have been most successful. Beyond understand that having a User Experience design is the trend that web design is following, it is also important to understand how to balance the design with the current budgets of the company, and also as you are developing a site to keep in mind how that experience will unfold as a user. Being mindful of the end goal, and the potential client impact is crucial and getting the product (site) as correct as possible the first time.

    What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
It is valuable because it can lead to increased revenue for a business. If you have a site that's informational, it could lead to user's returning to your site more than others for the information they are seeking. A pleasant user experience is key in using a site overall, because if you are capable of designing a site with a positive user experience, it makes you more appealing to employers as a whole.

    Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I think this is kind of a funny question. The part I probably enjoyed the least was getting started making the sitemap. I was kind of partial to just using pen and paper / whiteboarding it, because I like blending the mediums I use. Additionally, I thought the site I used, writemaps, could have been laid out a bit better, but that's just my opinion. Other than that I thought the exercise was fine, although I did expect it to be more HTML oriented.
