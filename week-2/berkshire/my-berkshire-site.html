<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was pretty cool, the HTML text part went fairly smoothly actually. Adding the image was done incorrectly, I have to admit that. relative paths are not my strong suit so I do need to properly practice with them, and or find a few more resources on them.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

The HTML Elements we used on the page didn't seem overly complex, so doing the reading and completing the codecademy courses seemed like plenty of Prep. This question makes me worry that I formatted a lot of stuff wrong or should have done things differently, liking using multiple H2's to indicate that the links are of secondary (but equal!) importance.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Not a problem, I think it's pretty well staged to be formatted in CSS. Minimal formatting accomplished.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The good is that it's fairly straightforward and that it is just text. The bad is that you have to mentally try and remember what that will actually look like as a finished product becuase it is just text.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't know if I have any tricks for writing HTML. I think what I've been exposed to has been fairly straightforward. The few things I do consistently are place the closing tag when I type the opening tag, and then just work in between them until I'm finished with that tag. I do also try and keep the tabbing consistent on the way down so things like body and table are easy to confirm where they end & begin.
