    What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a rough framework / outline that will be followed for designing a website. It will lack the same visual contents as the finalized site, but it should show the intended layout.
    What are the benefits of wireframing?
It helps keep a project in line as it provides the visual guide to what is being built. Also it determines the use of space ahead of time rather than figuring out what will go where as you are coding. Additionally, for multiple person projects, it allows a reference point to steer towards during the design and code.
    Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I did actually, I didn't find the reading all that exciting, but I enjoyed working with the wireframe more than I had expected. I did have to timebox myself and eventually say that it was time to move on.
    Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I made some revisions as I went, but I stuck with the general outline that I had first envisioned. I still used a header and footer, and tabs across the top like I had expected. The parts that changed were the image location and size, and what other content would fill up the rest of the page. The amount of tabs I used across the top also increased as I went, but I decided to cap it at 5 for now.

    What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I actually didn't end up having too many questions on the wireframing, I thought the readings did a good job of detailing what to loosely expect or follow while doing a wireframe, so I didn't have to look too much up. I did use mockflow to do the wireframe, just to familiarize myself with the resources available though.
    Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
The reading was definitely slower going than actually working on the wireframe for me. I also definitely could use more practice with inserting images using reference URL's rather than direct URL's. I may schedule some office hour time to cover that with someone a little bit extra (just a comment to remind myself).
